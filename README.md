# **2025 Training Performance Analysis: Session Delivery Overview**

## **Introduction**

This document provides an overview of the training performance across 2025. It aims to analyse the number of sessions delivered during the year to understand the overall demand for each course. The analysis supports data-driven planning for future training programs and helps identify areas with higher participation or emerging needs. This aligns with the organisationâ€™s goal to improve training effectiveness and resource allocation.

## **Objectives**

The key objectives of this documentation are to:

* Determine the total number of sessions delivered per course during 2025.
* Identify trends in session frequency across different training categories.
* Highlight areas of growth or decline to guide future program planning.
* Support decisions on course scheduling, instructor allocation, and resource investment.

Success will be measured by the clarity and accuracy of insights drawn from the data, enabling actionable planning for the next training cycle.

## **Scope**

The analysis covers all training sessions delivered between January and December 2025. It includes course titles, frequency, and participation data where available. The scope is limited to quantitative delivery metrics and does not include qualitative feedback or performance evaluation. All data is sourced from the internal training records and validated for consistency.

## **Methodology**

The analysis follows these key steps:

1. Collect and verify session data from the 2025 training records.
2. Organise courses by category and delivery frequency.
3. Apply filters to identify patterns and variations in demand.
4. Summarise findings in tables and charts for clarity.

This structured approach ensures that the data is complete, accurate, and ready for interpretation.

## **Expected Outcomes**

The expected outcomes of this analysis include:

* A clear summary of session delivery volume for each course.
* Insights into training demand trends across the year.
* Recommendations for strategic adjustments in future training plans.

The results will guide planning for the 2026 training calendar, ensuring efficient use of resources and alignment with learner demand.
